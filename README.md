### Intro ###

Our aim in this project is to clean up a corrupted audio files and obtain an output audio signal that is as close to the uncorrupted clean audio as possible. We are given with 10 channels of corrupted audio. Each contains uncorrelated noise with the same underlying signal. We need to utilize different signal filtering technique and determine how well it clean up the noise. Additionally, we are given clean audio as reference. We can use this as a benchmark on how well our filter perform qualitatively and quantitatively but we cannot use it in signal processing
